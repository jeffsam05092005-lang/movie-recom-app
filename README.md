⚙️ How It Works

Users log in and input their movie preferences or ratings.

The system fetches movie data using the TMDb API.

A recommendation engine (e.g., content-based filtering or collaborative filtering) processes user data.

The model suggests movies similar to the user’s interests.

Users can explore recommendations, rate movies, and update preferences for better suggestions over time.
